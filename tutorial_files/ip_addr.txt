 Checking network information for interfaces 

# ip addr show 

# ip addr show enp0s3

Enabling & disabling a network interface

# ip link set enp0s3 up

# ip link set enp0s3 down

Assigning IP address & other network information to an interface

# ip addr add 192.168.0.50/255.255.255.0 dev enp0s3
# ip addr add broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev enp0s3
# ip addr add broadcast 192.168.0.255 dev enp0s3


standarad broadcast address along with IP address 
# ip addr add 192.168.0.10/24 brd + dev enp0s3

Removing IP address from interface
# ip addr del 192.168.0.10/24 dev enp0s3

Adding an Alias for an  interface (enp0s3)

# ip addr add 192.168.0.20/24 dev enp0s3 label enp0s3:1


Checking route or default gateway information

# ip route show

Adding a static route 

# ip route add default via 192.168.0.150/24

For changing the default route for a single interface & to make change route further, execute
# ip route add 172.16.32.32 via 192.168.0.150/24 dev enp0s3

Removeing a static route

# ip route del 192.168.0.150/24


To make a persistence route change, we need to modify / create route-enp0s3 file . Add the following line  to it, demonstration is shown below

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-enp0s3

172.16.32.32 via 192.168.0.150/24 dev enp0s3


If you are using Ubuntu or debian based OS, than the location of the file is ‘/etc/network/interfaces‘ and  add the line “ip route add 172.16.32.32 via 192.168.0.150/24 dev enp0s3” to the bottom of the file.


[*] To view entries in ARP cache i.e. MAC addresses of the devices connected in LAN, the IP command used is

# ip neigh 


[*] To delete an ARP entry, the command used is

ip neigh del 192.168.0.106 dev enp0s3

[*] To add a new entry to the ARP cache 
#  ip neigh add 192.168.0.150 lladdr 33:1g:75:37:r3:84 dev enp0s3 nud perm

where nud menas neighbour state , it can be 


    perm – permanent & can only be removed by administrator,
    noarp – entry is valid but can be removed after lifetime expires,
    stale – entry is valid but suspicious,
    reachable – entry is valid until timeout expires.


[*] Checking network statistics 

# ip -s link 


[*] set MTU 
ip link set enp0s3 mtu 9600 


[*] check the status of the network devices 
# nmcli -p dev
